## Hardware

### Required

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| PedalPCB Terrarium (PCB351) Rev 2 | |
| **Daisy Seed3** | 64 MB SDRAM, USB-C. Seed 1 also works |
| 125B enclosure | |
| 6 x B10K 16 mm pots | **POT2 and POT5 must be CENTER DETENT** (Speed and Pitch) |
| 4 x SPDT ON/ON toggle, 6 mm | standard solder-lug pedal toggle, same footprint as every other PedalPCB board |
| 2 x SPST **momentary** footswitch | not 3PDT latching |

Passives per the Terrarium build doc. Note C2/C3/C6 are specified **MLCC**, not film. At
1 µF the footprint is 2.5 mm lead pitch, which does not exist in film.

### Pin map (Terrarium Rev 2)

PedalPCB labels the header pins `GPIO n`; libDaisy calls the same pin `D(n−1)`.

## Controls

Three pages of knob assignments, selected by SW1 and FS1.

| Page | How to reach it | Labelled on the panel |
|---|---|---|
| **1, primary** | SW1 down | yes |
| **2, shift** | SW1 up | yes |
| **3, tertiary** | SW1 up **and** FS1 held | no |

Page 3 lasts only as long as you hold FS1. Release and you are back on page 2.

### Full matrix

<img src="docs/Nebulae_v1.29_control_map.svg" width="680" alt="Nebulae v1.29 control map">

| Pot | 1 Primary | 2 SHIFT | 3 TERTIARY |

| **POT4** | DENSITY | OVERLAP | SHIFT MIX |
| **POT5** | PITCH (detent) | OUTPUT | FREQ SHIFT |

---

## Page 1, primary

| | |
|---|---|
| **START** | Loop start position within the recording |
| **SPEED** | -4x to +4x. Centre detent is unity. Negative is reverse |
| **SIZE** | Loop length, squared curve, scaling the space between Start and the end |
| **DENSITY** | Grain trigger rate, 0.12 to 983 Hz, hybrid tanh and cubic curve |
| **PITCH** | -3 to +2 octaves. Centre detent is unity |
| **BLEND** | Constant power across vocoder, dry and granular |

POT2 and POT5 are centre detent, and the detent lands exactly on unity for both. The
module uses encoders here; the knob curve is remapped so a pot behaves the same way.

---

## Page 2, shift

| | |
|---|---|
| **LFO 1 RATE** | 0.02 to 2 Hz, exponential. Default 0.02 Hz, one cycle every 50 seconds |
| **BLEND LFO DEPTH** | LFO 1 to Blend, bipolar, squared curve. Default 0 |
| **SPRAY** | Grain position randomisation, squared curve |
| **OVERLAP** | Grain length as a multiple of the grain period |
| **OUTPUT** | Monitoring level only, never reaches the recorder |
| **LFO 1 DEPTH** | 0 to a full loop, squared curve. Default 0 |

**SPRAY** is the module's Start secondary, restored. At zero every grain spawns from the
playhead, so concurrent grains all read identical audio and differ only in envelope phase.
The result is successive stutters rather than a cloud. Turning it up spawns grains from
random positions across the loop. This is the control that makes it sound granular.

**BLEND LFO DEPTH** routes LFO 1 to Blend as a second destination, sharing its rate and
shape. **Bipolar**, unlike the read-position destination: it sweeps either side of wherever
the Blend knob sits rather than anchoring at it. The gains are interpolated per sample
across each block, so a fast sweep cannot zipper.

Note that a Blend sweep crosses the dry position at centre, since the stock law runs
vocoder to dry to granular. At real depth you will hear dry come and go.

Input is recorded at **unity**. There is no input level control and no boost path after v1.29.

**OUTPUT** never reaches the recorder, so boosting it does not make overdubs compound on
themselves.

---

## Page 3, tertiary

Hold **FS1** while SW1 is up. There are no panel labels for these.

| | |
|---|---|
| **BANDPASS** | Centre is off. CCW sweeps down to 120 Hz, CW up to 6 kHz |
| **LFO 2 RATE** | 0.02 to 2 Hz. Also sets LFO 2's shape, see below |
| **LFO 2 DEPTH** | 0 to plus or minus one octave of loop length, squared curve |
| **SHIFT MIX** | Blends shifted against dry. Default full wet |
| **FREQ SHIFT** | Centre is off, then 0.5 Hz to 100 Hz either side |
| **GRAIN PITCH RAND** | Per-grain detune, 0 to plus or minus 120 cents |

### The page-3 toggle latch

**Hold page 3 and flip SW2 either direction.** LED2 blinks to confirm, and LFO 2 now
modulates the bandpass as well as loop length. Flip again to turn it off.

The firmware reads the **flip, not the position**. Entering page 3 takes a reference and
never acts on it, so the page cannot adopt wherever the lever happens to be sitting. Which
way you flip is irrelevant; only the transition counts.

SW2 keeps doing its normal SRC job throughout, including during page 3, so the lever never
lies about its own state. That means a page-3 flip also changes SRC, which is the
deliberate trade: an extra flip is better than a switch whose position means nothing.

SW3 and SW4 have no page-3 assignment, so the same latch pattern could be extended to
them at one flip each and no knobs. **Standing preference is not to**: both already carry
a primary function, and stacking more onto a lever is the kind of overloading this design
keeps trying to remove. See the Build 2 section, Tier 2 A4.

---

## Catch and pickup

**No secondary ever jumps to wherever the shared knob happens to sit.** Nothing adopts on
a page change, on the first visit, or at power-on.

On **page 1** this is pure catch: the parameter waits indefinitely until the knob crosses
its stored value. The panel legend means something there, so knob position stays honest.

On **pages 2 and 3** catch has a **give-up threshold**. If you turn a knob more than about
15% of its travel without crossing the stored value, it stops waiting and takes over where
you are, crossfading over 25 ms so there is no click. That fixes the case where a stored
value sits at an extreme: without it, a parameter defaulting to 0.0 needs a full
counter-clockwise sweep before it responds at all, and reads as dead.

Merely changing pages never causes a takeover. The travel counter resets on every page
change, so a jump only ever follows a deliberate turn.

---

## Footswitches and LEDs

| | |
|---|---|
| **FS1** | tap (on release) = bypass, **hold 1 s = reset pages 2 and 3** |
| **FS2** | tap = record, **hold 1 s = clear buffer** |
| **LED1** | lit = engaged |
| **LED2** | lit = recording, blinks = buffer cleared, blinks = page-3 latch changed |

### FS1 in detail

FS1 does three different jobs depending on SW1 and how long you hold it.

| SW1 | Action | Result |
|---|---|---|
| down | tap | bypass toggles, on release |
| down | hold 1 s | resets every page 2 and page 3 parameter to its default |
| **up** | **hold** | **page 3, for as long as it is held** |
| **up** | **tap** | **nothing** |

> **With SW1 up, FS1 will not bypass.** While SW1 is up, FS1 is the page-3 modifier, so it
> neither toggles bypass nor starts the reset timer. Whatever bypass state you were in is
> held, so if the pedal was engaged, LED1 stays lit and you cannot switch it off.
> **Flip SW1 down first, then tap FS1.** The reset is likewise only reachable with SW1 down.

Bypass fires on **release**, not press, so that holding FS1 for a reset does not also flip
bypass on the way in. That costs a few hundred milliseconds, imperceptible by hand.

### The reset

Holding FS1 for one second with SW1 down returns all nine page-2 and page-3 parameters to
their power-on defaults: LFO 1 rate and both depths, spray, overlap, output, LFO 2
rate and depth, bandpass, shift mix, freq shift and pitch rand.

**Page 1 is deliberately untouched.** Resetting it would leave all six knobs uncaught and
the pedal would ignore every control until each was swept. After a reset the affected pots
are uncaught, which is the point: the hidden pages go back to a known state.

It is kept separate from the FS2 buffer clear.

---

## Effects (page 3)

Three processors, applied after the record tap. They are **monitoring and playback only**:
the buffer never contains them, so overdubbing with an effect engaged neither bakes it in
nor compounds it across passes. Chain order is freq shifter, then bandpass.

### Freq shift

Bode-style single-sideband shifter: Hilbert transform through two 4-section allpass chains
(Niemitalo coefficients), then quadrature modulation against a quadrature oscillator,
**one sideband only**. That detail is what makes it inharmonic rather than ring mod. Image
rejection measured at 46 dB.

Dead zone at centre, then exponential **0.5 Hz to 100 Hz** each side, so most of the travel
sits in the 1 to 30 Hz zone where sidebands colour the tone without destroying pitch.

```
1:00  ->   1.3 Hz     slow beating
2:00  ->   3.8 Hz
3:00  ->  11.2 Hz     sidebands start reading as timbre
4:00  ->  33.5 Hz
5:00  -> 100.0 Hz
```

An earlier version ran 2 Hz to 2 kHz. Everything past about 3:30 read as a resonant sweep
rather than a shift, so two thirds of the knob were unusable.

**SHIFT MIX** (POT4) blends shifted against dry. Hearing both together is the classic Bode
usage: the two beat against each other, which reads as movement rather than the flat
detune of a fully wet shift. Around halfway is where the beating is strongest.

### Bandpass

TPT state-variable filter, 12 dB/oct, Q of 1.0, last in the chain. Centre is off. The wet
amount fades in over the first 15% of travel either side, so there is no jump leaving the
dead zone, and the frequency mapping is exponential so the knob tracks pitch.

```
0.00 ->  120 Hz
0.25 ->  339 Hz
0.50 ->  OFF
0.75 -> 2257 Hz
1.00 -> 6000 Hz
```

A bandpass throws away everything outside its passband, so perceived level drops even
though the peak itself is unity: measured -14 dB at 200 Hz against -0.7 dB at 6 kHz before
compensation. Makeup gain scales with wet amount, reaching about +5 dB fully engaged.

24 dB/oct was considered and rejected. A steeper filter removes more energy, so it gets
quieter, not louder. Makeup gain is the right lever.

With the page-3 latch on, LFO 2 sweeps it bipolar and exponential, plus or minus 2 octaves
at full depth, centred on whatever the knob is set to. Clamped to 40 Hz and 12 kHz, so
extreme settings narrow the sweep rather than wrapping.

```
knob sets     lfo -1     lfo +1     span
   339 Hz        85       1356      4.0 octaves
  2257 Hz       564       9026      4.0 octaves
  6000 Hz      1500      12000      3.0 octaves
```

### Grain pitch randomisation

The module's Pitch secondary, restored. Each grain gets its own detune, assigned once at
launch and held for that grain's life. Per grain, not per sample: per sample would be FM.

Stock is `rand(amt * 1200)`, bipolar cents, so plus or minus an octave at full. That is far
too wide to stay musical, so this uses a squared curve to **plus or minus 120 cents**.

```
knob   max cents   rms cents
0.25      7.5         4.3
0.50     30.0        17.3
0.75     67.5        39.0
1.00    120.0        69.1
```

Quarter travel is chorus territory. Half is audible detune. Most of the knob stays subtle.
RMS runs about 58% of the maximum because the distribution is uniform, so typical grains
sit well inside the extreme.

Pair it with SPRAY. Spray decorrelates **where** grains read, pitch rand decorrelates **how
fast**. Together they are what makes the grain cloud sound like a cloud.

---

## LFO 1, read position

An addition, not part of the original module. It modulates read position only.

### Shape

A sine with its phase warped before the sine is taken:

```
warp(p) = p / (2s)                    for p < s
          0.5 + (p - s) / (2(1 - s))  for p >= s
out     = sin(2 * pi * warp(p))
```

`s` is the skew, fixed at **0.65**. At `s = 0.5` this reduces to an ordinary sine.

The warp stretches the first 65% of the cycle across the first half of the sine and
compresses the remaining 35% into the second half, so the rise is slow and the fall is
quick. It stays smooth throughout, with no corners or discontinuities.

One cycle sampled in 24 steps, against a pure sine:

```
skew 0.65  +0.20 +0.39 +0.57 +0.72 +0.85 +0.94 +0.99 +1.00 +0.97 +0.90 +0.80 +0.66
           +0.50 +0.32 +0.12 -0.15 -0.50 -0.78 -0.96 -1.00 -0.90 -0.68 -0.37  0.00

sine       +0.26 +0.50 +0.71 +0.87 +0.97 +1.00 +0.97 +0.87 +0.71 +0.50 +0.26 -0.00
           -0.26 -0.50 -0.71 -0.87 -0.97 -1.00 -0.97 -0.87 -0.71 -0.50 -0.26  0.00
```

The rise takes 15 of 24 steps; the fall takes 9.

<img src="lfo.png" width="320" alt="lfo visual">

### How it moves the sound

**It offsets read position, not loop geometry.** Loop start and loop length are computed
before the LFO is applied and are never touched by it, so playback rate and loop boundaries
stay fixed. Only the point being read within the loop moves.

**It is unipolar.** The sine's -1 to +1 range is mapped to 0 to +1, so the offset only ever
pushes forward from the playhead, never behind it. The sweep therefore anchors at the Start
position.

```
uni  = (sin_out + 1) * 0.5          ->  0 to 1
read = phasor + uni * depth^2
```

Depth is squared. At full depth the offset covers an entire loop, so the read position
scans forward through the whole buffer and returns.

**Both engines follow it together**, since they share the read position. The vocoder
time-warps as the read point moves and grains spawn from the moving position. At low depth
this is tape-like wobble; at high depth it becomes a slow scan through the loop.

**Rate is 0.02 to 2 Hz, exponential** (50 seconds per cycle at the slow end).

The asymmetry is what reads as motion rather than oscillation. A symmetric sine feels like
rocking in place; this drifts forward and resets.

### Controls

| | |
|---|---|
| **SHIFT + POT1** | LFO 1 RATE, shared by both destinations |
| **SHIFT + POT6** | LFO 1 DEPTH to read position, unipolar (0 = off, bit-identical to no LFO) |
| **SHIFT + POT2** | LFO 1 DEPTH to Blend, bipolar (0 = off) |

Two destinations, independent depth, shared rate and shape. Read position is unipolar so
the sweep anchors at Start; Blend is bipolar so it sweeps either side of the knob.

---

## LFO 2, global

Page 3. Rate on POT2, depth on POT3. It is **normalled to loop length** and can be routed
to the bandpass as a second destination by flipping SW2 while page 3 is held.

One rate, one depth, one shape, shared across every destination. Depth at zero leaves them
all still, so routing costs nothing until you use it.

### Loop length, the normalled destination

Bipolar, multiplying loop length by `2^(depth^2 * lfo)`, so full depth breathes between
half and double length while the playhead rate follows inversely. Multiplicative, so it
feels uniform across Size's squared curve. **Recording uses the unmodulated length**, so
the buffer itself never breathes, only playback.

### Shape follows its own rate

Where LFO 1's skew is fixed, LFO 2's tracks its rate:

```
rate 0.00  ->  skew 0.350    quick rise, long sink
rate 0.50  ->  skew 0.425
rate 1.00  ->  skew 0.500    plain sine
```

At the slow end the asymmetry is audible as motion, so the shape is worth having. As the
rate climbs, that shape stops reading as shape and just colours the wobble, so it eases to
symmetric. One knob sets both.

An output curve of 0.6 is applied on top, fixed, which pushes the LFO toward its extremes.
It spends about 80% of each cycle beyond half depth, so it snaps away from centre,
blossoms, then eases back rather than rocking evenly through the middle.

---

## How to use it

### Load your first loop

1. **SW2 to IN**
2. Tap **FS2**, recording starts
3. Play
4. Tap **FS2**, recording stops

In IN mode nothing else affects what is recorded. Loop length is set by where you stop.

### Hear it

5. **BLEND** sets the mix. Fully CCW is the phase vocoder, centre is dry, fully CW is
   granular
6. **SPRAY** (SHIFT+POT3) is what turns stuttering into a grain cloud
7. **DENSITY** and **OVERLAP** shape the texture. Under FREEZE, grain length is the
   stutter length, so Overlap makes it longer and Density retriggers it faster

### Overdub

8. **SW2 to MIX**
9. Tap **FS2** once

Recording **punches in at the current playhead, runs exactly one loop pass, and stops
itself.** You do not tap FS2 again. Loop length is locked, so an overdub cannot shorten
the loop.

The record source is engine output plus your input, independent of BLEND, and recorded at
unity. Page-3 effects are not captured, so overdubbing with the shifter up will not bake it
in or compound it across passes.

### Reach page 3

With SW1 up, **hold FS1**. Release to return to page 2. Every page-3 control needs
catching, but the give-up threshold means about a sixth of a turn is enough.

### Clear and reset

Hold **FS2** one second to clear the buffer. Hold **FS1** one second, with SW1 down, to
reset pages 2 and 3 to defaults. LED2 blinks either way.

### Considerations

- The buffer is **volatile**. Power down loses it
- Layers are mixed destructively into one buffer. There is no undo and no way to adjust a
  layer after it is recorded
- With SIZE below maximum an overdub covers only that fraction of the loop and stops
  early. That is stock behaviour, since the module ties overdub length to loop size the
  same way
- At unity speed and unity pitch with SPRAY and PITCH RAND at zero, every concurrent grain
  reads identical audio and differs only in envelope phase. That is why it sounds stuttery
  rather than granular. Raise either one, or move PITCH off its detent
- A page-3 flip of SW2 also changes SRC, by design. The lever never lies about its own
  physical toggle position

## Versions

**Current: `nebulae_v1.29-BUILD1.bin`**

Two hardware variants build from one source tree. **BUILD1** is the toggle-SW1 pedal.
**BUILD2** adds the illuminated page-3 button and bi-colour LED2, built with
`make EXTRA_DEFS=-DBUILD2=1`. A BUILD1 binary only ships when build 1 actually changes.

| Version | Change |
|---|---|
| **1.29** | **Current.** Record tap moved ahead of the page-3 effects, so they are non-destructive and no longer compound across overdubs. SHIFT+POT2 becomes BLEND LFO DEPTH; DUB LVL removed and input records at unity |
| 1.28 | Expodec decay floor 0.001 to 0.003, so the tail runs about a sixth longer at every level. Attack unchanged |
| 1.27 | LED2 blinks to confirm the FS1 parameter reset on both builds |
| 1.26 | Page-3 LFO latch moved to SW2, which keeps its normal SRC job throughout |
| 1.25 | LFO 2 routable to the bandpass by flipping a toggle while page 3 is held, LED2 confirms |
| 1.24 | Grain pitch randomisation on page 3. LFO 2 skew now follows its own rate. Phaser removed |
| 1.23 | Catch gains a 15% give-up takeover on pages 2 and 3. Page 1 stays pure catch |
| 1.22 | Phaser deepened to 3 chains and 10 stages. Bandpass makeup gain |
| 1.21 | Page 3 rearranged. Phaser speed tracked the LFO 2 rate |
| 1.20 | Sweepable bandpass, last in the chain |
| 1.18 to 1.19 | Barber-pole phaser, later removed |
| 1.17 | Size LFO skew exposed, later folded into rate |
| 1.16 | Size LFO shape: mirrored skew plus an output curve |
| 1.15 | Freq shift dry/wet mix |
| 1.14 | Freq shift range cut to 0.5 Hz to 100 Hz. The old 2 kHz top read as a resonant sweep |
| 1.13 | Reset moved to FS1 hold. Bypass moved to release |
| 1.12 | Parameter reset for pages 2 and 3 |
| 1.11 | Build 2 variant gated behind a single `BUILD2` define |
| **1.10** | Third page on SW1 up plus FS1 held. Size LFO and freq shifter. Catch generalised to three pages |
| 1.9.7 | OUTPUT no longer reaches the recorder. With output boosted, every overdub had been writing the loop back louder and compounding |
| 1.9.6 | DUB LVL boots at unity. The init still meant unity on the old input-level curve but -12 dB on the new one |
| 1.9.5 | Record source is engine output plus input, independent of BLEND. At either Blend extreme the dry factor is zero, so overdubs had captured engine output only |
| 1.9.4 | SPRAY on SHIFT+POT3, ported from the Csound. Window moved onto the SW3 toggle |
| 1.9.3 | Record fixed. The overdub latch check ran before the engine had acted on a fresh tap, so it cleared the latch on the block that set it |
| 1.9.1 | Punch-in overdub. Also fixed a v1.9 bug where booting with SHIFT up made the shift page adopt knob positions outright |
| **1.9** | Catch resumes without a re-catch only if the parameter was live when leaving the page |
| 1.8 | RMS limiter moved to control rate. Fixed the grain crackle at high Overlap |
| 1.7 | Skip the engine whose blend coefficient is exactly zero |
| 1.6 | Output level on SHIFT+POT5 |
| 1.5 | Unipolar LFO depth. Catch tolerance widened from 0.2% to 2% |
| 1.1 to 1.4 | Catch adopt, expodec floor, LFO curve, density taper. All reverted |
| **1.0** | **Audio block size 64 to 512.** The critical fix, see below |
| 0.1 to 0.9 | Bring-up: clear, LFO, heartbeat, input level, pot smoothing, FTZ, DC block, soft limit |

**Two branches.** The `1.x` line is the maintained one. `2.x-ALEXTBLEND` keeps the 2-way
engine blend with dry on its own knob, but has no SPRAY, no page 3 and no effects.

<details>
<summary><b>Controls for the 2.x-ALEXTBLEND branch (click to expand)</b></summary>

<br>

The 2.x branch replaces the stock 3-way blend with a 2-way engine crossfade and moves dry
onto its own control. Under the stock law the vocoder and grains never overlap, since voc
fades out by centre and grain fades in after it. The 2.x law lets both sound together.

| | Primary | SHIFT |
|---|---|---|
| **POT1** | START | LFO RATE |
| **POT2** | SPEED (detent) | DRY/WET |
| **POT3** | SIZE | WINDOW |
| **POT4** | DENSITY | OVERLAP |
| **POT5** | PITCH (detent) | OUTPUT |
| **POT6** | BLEND, vocoder to granular only | LFO DEPTH |

BLEND becomes purely the balance between the two engines. Centre gives 0.707 of each
rather than pure dry. DRY/WET on SHIFT+POT2 is the main output mix and boots fully wet.

This branch has no SPRAY, no page 3 and no effects section, and its Window is still on a
knob. It is far behind the 1.x line and is kept only for anyone who prefers that blend
behaviour.

## Deviations from stock

| | |
|---|---|
| **Mono** | Terrarium is single in / single out. Loses grain stereo spread |
| **120 s buffer** | vs 5 min. Volatile, with no file, USB, SD or sample loading anywhere |
| **Secondaries mostly dropped** | Most `_alt` params fixed at 0, which *is* stock-at-defaults. SPRAY and grain pitch rand are restored |
| **Speed/Pitch remap** | Centre detent lands on unity. Endpoints preserved exactly. The module uses encoders, we use pots |
| **SPRAY, OUTPUT** | SPRAY is the module's Start secondary, restored. OUTPUT is an addition, since the Terrarium is unity gain throughout |
| **Effects are non-destructive** | The record tap sits ahead of them, so the buffer never contains freq shift or bandpass and overdubs cannot compound the effect |
| **Overdub ignores BLEND** | Stock scales the recorded dry by the blend dry factor, which is zero at both extremes. Correct for the module, wrong for a looper |
| **Catch mode** | One pot serving two parameters requires it |
| **Expodec window** | Replaces the stock linear ramp-down, on a toggle so it can be A/B'd |
| **LFO 1** | Not stock. Modulates read position only, so loop geometry is untouched |
| **LFO 2, freq shift, phaser, bandpass** | Not stock. Page 3 additions. Freq shift uses the Hilbert core from kuttor's SuperNova firmware with a re-mapped range. The barber-pole phaser is an original implementation of a well-documented algorithm class |
| **Input/output level** | Terrarium is unity gain; a guitar sits ~20 dB below where the grain RMS limiter engages |
| **DC block, output soft limit, block size 512** | Platform necessities |

Freeze and Reset are not on footswitches: Freeze is literally `kspeed = 0` in the original,
so a toggle does it, and Reset only mattered for CV sync.

## Notes from the port

**Block size was the one serious bug.** `mincer` computes an entire frame (two forward
FFTs, one inverse, two 1025-bin loops, and a 2048-sample interpolated SDRAM read) inside a
single audio callback. At 64 samples that's 1.33 ms of budget against ~1.4 ms of work, so
one block in eight overran: a dropout 94x/second that sounded like digital garble. Nebulae
itself runs Csound on a Pi with a ~42 ms output buffer, so its frame work is invisible.

**Sample-exact diffing is the wrong test for a phase vocoder.** `div = 1/(hypot(prev)+1e-20)`
reaches ~1e20 at empty bins, so float rounding compounds through the feedback path. Frame 0
matches the reference to 7.4e-08; after that the waveforms diverge while remaining
spectrally identical to −58 dB. Acceptance criteria are frame-0 agreement, unity gain, exact
pitch ratios and magnitude spectrum. The granular side, being non-recursive, is held to
sample-exact and passes at 2e-07.

**`giHamming` is not Hamming.** The instrument declares `ftgen 20, 9, 1` and comments it
"Hamming Window". GEN20 type 9 is **Sinc**. This matters: sinc reaches exactly 0 at both
endpoints, a real Hamming bottoms at 0.08 and would click at every grain boundary.

**The grain RMS stage is a limiter, not a leveler.** Identity below 0.20, attenuation above.
It never boosts, which is why input level matters on a guitar-level platform.

**Density never reaches its stated 2500 Hz.** The hybrid tanh/cubic scalar tops out at
0.906, so the real maximum is ~983 Hz.

## Build 2 plans

Waiting on a Terrarium PCB restock. Everything else is ordered or on hand.

### How to read this section

Build 2 has been designed more than once. Rather than deleting older plans, they are kept
as tiers. Nothing below is dead unless it is in Tier 4.

| Tier | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **1, PRIMARY** | The current plan. Build this unless there is a reason not to |
| **2, ALTERNATE** | Superseded but coherent and buildable. Each entry says what replaced it and why |
| **3, OPEN** | Undecided or unverified. Resolve before assembly |
| **4, REJECTED** | Ruled out, with the reason, so it is not re-proposed |

When a Tier 1 entry changes, the old version moves to Tier 2 rather than being removed.

---

## TIER 1, PRIMARY

### Panel

SW1 stays a toggle. A **seventh hole** is added for an illuminated momentary button with a
bi-colour LED.

### The button is LFO mode

The button is the LFO layer, not a page-3 modifier. See Tier 2 A2 for the plan this
replaced.

- **Tap** to latch into LFO mode. First tap selects LFO 1, LED red. Second tap selects
  LFO 2, LED green. Third tap exits.
- **Hold** for momentary access to the last LFO page used, LED lit while held, drops out on
  release. This is the fast path for a single edit.

Tap-latch plus momentary-hold is the same pattern the existing page-3 toggle latch uses, so
it is a shape both the firmware and the hands already know.

### Two independent LFOs, no split

Both LFOs are fully independent and either can target any parameter, including the same
parameter at once. Knobs are **not** hard-assigned to one LFO or the other. See Tier 2 A3
for the split scheme this replaced.

### LFO mode control map

Within LFO mode, on the selected LFO's page:

| Pot | Primary label | Function in LFO mode |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Start | Depth for Start |
| 2 | Speed | **LFO rate** for the selected LFO |
| 3 | Size | Depth for Size |
| 4 | Density, or BPF, see O5 | Depth for that parameter |
| 5 | Pitch | **LFO skew** for the selected LFO |
| 6 | Blend | Depth for Blend |

Pots 2 and 5 carry rate and skew because Speed and Pitch do not take LFOs, so those knobs
are otherwise idle in this layer. Pot 2 is already labelled Speed, so the label reads
correctly for its LFO-mode job at no cost. Pot 5 is centre detent, which suits skew:
detent at symmetric, CCW one way, CW the other.

Pages are what make two LFOs fit on the panel at all. Two LFOs need four controls for rate
and skew and only two knobs are free, so page 1 and page 2 each carry one LFO's pair.

**The hard constraint:** the LFO layer has exactly **four destination slots per LFO**, and
they mirror page 1's knobs minus Speed and Pitch. Any destination that is not a page 1
parameter has to displace one that is. Bandpass is the first case, see O5.

### Existing LFO controls are removed

All current LFO secondary and tertiary controls come out. The LFO layer becomes the only
place LFOs are configured. That is the point of the rework: one location, not three.

### LEDs

| | |
|---|---|
| **LED1** | blue or violet, engaged |
| **LED2** | 3 mm red/green bi-colour, common cathode. Red recording, green playback, blinks for confirmations |
| **Button LED** | red for LFO 1, green for LFO 2 |

### Firmware status

**This configuration does not exist yet.** The current `BUILD2` define makes the button
replace SW1, which is the Tier 2 A1 arrangement. Add LFO mode as a third configuration, or
repurpose `BUILD2`, before build 2 is assembled.

### Button mounting

The DAIER illuminated tact switch has no nut and no panel bushing, so it cannot be fastened
the way a pot or jack is. Mount it on a small perfboard held against the underside of the
enclosure top, cap protruding through the hole.

- Position between the two LEDs, slightly lower if it fits. Check clearance against the
  Terrarium PCB below before committing
- Drill the hole slightly larger than the cap so it does not bind at the end of travel
- Set standoff height so the cap sits proud at rest by more than the switch travel, or it
  bottoms out on the enclosure before actuating
- Hot glue works but cures rigid and is awkward to remove. Nylon standoffs with
  double-sided foam, or a shim stack, are easier to revise
- Wire and test the switch before gluing anything

### Free Seed pins

D0 to D6, D11 to D14, D24, D27 to D30.

Solder to the **underside of the Terrarium female header**, never to the Seed itself, so the
module stays removable for bench flashing. Do all flywiring before the board goes in the
enclosure. Each LED leg needs its own 1K.

### Ordered and on hand

Black powder-coated 125B, black toggles, 3 mm red/green bi-colour LEDs, illuminated SPST
momentary buttons, Daisy Seed3, centre-detent and plain B10K pots, Lumberg jacks, headers,
OPA2134, trimmers, 100 uF polymer rail caps, WIMA film set, Panasonic 10 uF, Davies knobs.

## TIER 2, ALTERNATE

### A1. Button replaces SW1 in the SW1 hole

Tap latches shift, hold gives page 3. No seventh hole.

**This is what the current `BUILD2` define actually builds**, so it is the only Tier 2 entry
that exists in firmware today.

**Superseded by:** the seventh hole, because it left FS1 carrying a page-3 hold whose
meaning depended on SW1 with nothing on the panel to say which.

**Still viable if:** drilling a seventh hole proves impractical, or the button cannot be
mounted cleanly. Costs no new firmware.

### A2. Button is a page-3 modifier only

SW1 stays a toggle, seventh hole added, button is a plain momentary page-3 modifier with its
LED lit while held, and FS1's page-3 special case is deleted.

**Superseded by:** LFO mode, which uses the button for a layer that needs it more.

**The problem it solved still matters.** On build 1, holding FS1 means page 3 with SW1 up and
parameter reset with SW1 down, and nothing on the panel says which. Reaching for page 3 with
SW1 down wipes pages 2 and 3 instead. If LFO mode takes the button, page 3 goes back onto FS1
and this collision returns, unless O1 resolves in its favour.

### A3. Hard split of knobs between the two LFOs

Each knob permanently assigned to one LFO. The button LED indicates which is selected.

**Superseded by:** two independent LFOs, judged less restrictive and less confusing.

**Its one advantage:** depth knobs leave the mode entirely, since each knob has exactly one
depth value regardless of selection, so you never need to know which page you are on to set a
depth. Worth revisiting if two pages of depth values prove hard to track in practice.

### A4. LFO destination latches on SW3 and SW4

Additional LFO destinations bought one toggle flip at a time, no knobs required. The pattern
already exists on SW2.

**Superseded by:** continuous per-destination depth in LFO mode, which is strictly more
expressive than a fixed-depth on/off latch.

**Standing preference against:** both toggles already carry a primary function, and stacking
more onto a lever is the overloading this design keeps trying to remove.

---

## TIER 3, OPEN

### O1. Does page 3 still have content?

Once LFO destinations move into LFO mode, page 3 may be nearly empty. This decides whether
A2's collision problem is real.

- If page 3 still holds functions, FS1 keeps a hold function and the SW1 collision needs its own
  answer
- If page 3 empties, FS1 returns to unconditional bypass and reset, and the collision dies as
  a side effect of the LFO rework rather than as its purpose

Check against the live control matrix above. **Highest-value open item**, because it decides
whether the seventh hole is still earning its place.

**Counted against the live matrix, it is one control away from emptying.**

LFO mode removes LFO controls from *both* pages, not just page 3:

```
page 2 loses    LFO 1 RATE (POT1), BLEND LFO DEPTH (POT2), LFO 1 DEPTH (POT6)
page 2 keeps    SPRAY, OVERLAP, OUTPUT                  ->  3 free slots
page 3 loses    LFO 2 RATE, LFO 2 DEPTH
page 3 keeps    bandpass, shift mix, freq shift, pitch rand  ->  4 survivors
```

Four survivors into three free slots. One over, so page 3 has to stay for a single control,
FS1 keeps its hold, and the A2 collision returns.

**Drop or fix any one of the four and page 3 disappears entirely.** Then the remaining
three fit page 2 exactly, FS1 returns to unconditional bypass and reset, and the collision
dies as a side effect. The seventh hole then buys LFO mode outright rather than splitting
duty.

SHIFT MIX is **not** a candidate for fixing: independent shift mix is one of the more
musical controls on the pedal and its adjustability is the point. So the seventh control
needs a home rather than a fixed value. Options: a centre-off pairing on page 2, moving one
control to a toggle latch, or a fourth page on SW1 down plus FS1 held.

### O2. Catch and takeover in LFO mode

Every LFO depth defaults to zero, which is an extreme. That is the same shape as the known
trap where a parameter defaulting to 0.0 needs a full counter-clockwise sweep before pure
catch picks it up, so the knob reads as dead.

With two LFO pages, every depth knob has two stored values, so entering either page lands all
of them on values the physical position does not match.

**The 15% give-up takeover must extend to both LFO pages from the first build.** Without it,
every depth knob feels broken on first touch, times two pages.

### O3. LFO rate range rework

Confirmed on build 1: LFO 2 past 12:00 CCW is not dead, just extremely slow. The cause is the
rate range, not catch and not the detent.

Proposed: raise the slow floor from **0.02 Hz to 0.1 Hz**, a 10 second cycle. **Keep the
2 Hz ceiling.** That narrows the span from 6.6 octaves to 4.3, so every degree of rotation
covers less frequency ratio and the whole sweep gains resolution, including the fast end
that currently feels narrow.

```
floor 0.02 Hz   50 s cycle   6.6 octaves   today
floor 0.05 Hz   20 s cycle   5.3 octaves   if more slow drift is wanted
floor 0.10 Hz   10 s cycle   4.3 octaves   proposed
```

**Raising the ceiling does the opposite.** It widens the span and makes every degree
coarser. Only the floor move gets what was asked for.

The 46.9 Hz aliasing limit is in Tier 4 as the hard ceiling. It is nowhere near anything
worth setting here.

**Measure before changing.** Read the actual mapping in the source rather than assuming.

### O4. Faceplate artwork

The repo image is `Nebulae1.9.7Decal_9-8-26.png`. The filename is a version behind.

Previously the artwork was still correct because page 3 was unlabelled. **An LFO layer
changes that.** If pots 2 and 5 carry rate and skew in LFO mode, the panel arguably needs
secondary labelling the current decal does not have. Decide before etching.

### O5. Bandpass has no destination slot. This is a regression, not an enhancement

**Resolve this or build 2 ships with less modulation than build 1.**

The LFO mode map has exactly **four depth slots per LFO**: pots 1, 3, 4 and 6, since pots 2
and 5 carry rate and skew. Under the current Tier 1 map those four are Start, Size, Density
and Blend. **Bandpass is not among them.**

Build 1 can already route LFO 2 to the bandpass at plus or minus 2 octaves. So as Tier 1
stands, build 2 loses a working feature and gains an untested one in its place. The trade is
specifically **proven bandpass sweep against Density modulation that has never existed on
this pedal**.

**Density does not need an LFO.** Size does: it is LFO 2's normalled destination today and
loop length breathing is one of the better modulations on the pedal. So pot 4 taking bandpass
instead of Density is the straightforward fix.

**One catch, worth knowing before the panel is drilled.** If SHIFT MIX gets fixed and page 3
collapses (see O1), bandpass frequency lands on page 2, on POT1, POT2 or POT6, since POT3 to
POT5 are already taken by spray, overlap and output. Its depth would still be pot 4 in LFO
mode. **The knob holding the parameter and the knob holding its depth stop being the same
knob**, which is the one place the whole scheme's logic breaks.

**An option not otherwise considered:** the two LFO pages could carry different destination
sets, with pot 4 as Density depth on the LFO 1 page and bandpass depth on the LFO 2 page.
That gets all five destinations across eight slots. It costs the uniformity that makes the
scheme easy to hold in your head, so it is only worth reaching for if the Density-versus-
bandpass choice turns out to be genuinely painful.

### O6. Input boost

Undecided. Non-inverting OPA2134 stage between the input jack and the Terrarium IN pad, gain
4 to 6x, 100K trimmer, powered from the board +5 V and VREF, shielded cable routed away from
the Seed.

This is the **only** gain in the chain that can improve signal to noise, since OUTPUT is
applied after the converter and lifts signal and noise identically. A guitar currently hits
the ADC around 25 dB below full scale, wasting that much converter range.

It does not worsen mixer noise. The mixer is downstream and sees a hotter, cleaner signal, so
it needs less makeup gain of its own.

**Test it for free first** by putting a clean boost pedal in front of the current build and
listening on headphones. That is electrically the same experiment.

Gain above roughly 6x clips IC1.1 before the converter sees it, since the audio rail is +5 V
with VREF at 2.5 V, giving about 3.5 Vpp of swing.

### O7. Terrarium PCB restock

Alert is set. No alternate source exists. PedalPCB has not published Terrarium board files,
so there is nothing to send to a fab.

### O8. Panel-mount USB-C pigtail

Optional, so the Seed can be reflashed without pulling it. Round hole, avoids cutting a
rectangular slot in cast aluminium.

---

## TIER 4, REJECTED

### DIP switches

Funbox uses them to select which of several firmwares to load. This project has one engine,
and the page latch already covers configuration from the panel without taking the back off.

### Audio rate LFO

Block size 512 puts the control rate at 93.75 Hz, so anything above about 46.9 Hz aliases.
Reaching audio rate would mean restructuring the block size, which is fixed at 512 because a
mincer frame does not fit in 64. Structurally closed, not a tuning question.

### Shape selection buttons

Bastl Thyme style, eight LFO shapes on eight dedicated buttons. There is no panel space, and
swept skew on a triangle already covers ramp-down through triangle through ramp-up
continuously, which is most of what those shapes provide. The one thing skew cannot give is
random.

### Adding functions to toggles

Both spare toggles already carry a primary function. Standing preference: do not add
functions to toggles unless there is no alternative.

---

## Known limitations

- **Noise floor.** The Terrarium's analog path is unity gain, so a guitar hits the ADC
  20 to 30 dB below full scale. OUTPUT is applied *after* the converter and cannot improve
  SNR. The only real fix is analog gain ahead of the pedal. See the input
  boost under Build 2 plans
- **No stereo.** Seed pins 17/19 are unused; a second output buffer would give dual mono.
  True stereo needs a second vocoder and grain cloud. CPU is fine, memory is the limit
- **Bypass is buffered, not true bypass.** Audio always passes through the codec. Loss of
  power means loss of signal
- **~43 ms vocoder latency** against the dry path. Inherent to a 2048-point FFT, and stock
  behaviour
- The module locks Speed/Start/Size during recording and snaps Speed/Pitch to unity after an
  overdub. Neither is implemented, and the second is impossible with pots
